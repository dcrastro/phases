#### Moon Phases Visualization Tool ####

This project is the result of experimenting with OpenAI's ChatGPT to
develop a tool for visualizing the phases of the Moon. It is licensed
under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details. The project
source code is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/dcrastro/phases](https://github.com/dcrastro/phases).

To use the tool, navigate to [https://dcrastro.github.io/phases/phases.html](https://dcrastro.github.io/phases/phases.html). You can drag the scene around and zoom in/out using pointer gestures, adjust the Moon's position in its orbit using the slider, and switch to the geocentric view with the toggle.
